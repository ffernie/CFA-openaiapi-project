## Introduction
Suzano, a leading player in the pulp and paper industry, has remained undervalued in the market due to overlooked competitive advantages. The Fundação Getúlio Vargas, representing CFA Society Brazil, is initiating coverage with a **buy recommendation** and a target price of R$67, representing a **29% upside**.

## Company Overview
- **Leadership in Market**: Suzano is the world's largest pulp producer, accounting for over **30%** of global capacity.
- **Operational Structure**: The company has a fully integrated operation from forestry management to the production and delivery of diverse paper products.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Climate change presents both challenges and opportunities; Suzano contributes to sustainable material alternatives, specifically targeting fossil-based products.

## Key Catalysts for Buy Recommendation
1. **Low-Cost Position**: Suzano's operations in Brazil allow for unmatched production efficiency, achieving one of the lowest cash costs in the industry.
2. **Market Over-Pessimism**: Despite short-term challenges, long-term perceptions of pulp prices are overly pessimistic.
3. **New Mill Development**: The introduction of the Cerrado mill is expected to enhance operational resilience and efficiency.
4. **ESG Under-Recognition**: Suzano's strong ESG position is not fully recognized in the market, presenting potential for appreciation.

## Competitive Advantages
- **Geographical Edge**: Brazil's climatic and infrastructural advantages allow for high productivity in eucalyptus cultivation, essential for pulp production.
- **Cost Analysis**: An analysis shows that replicating Suzano's position would require more than four times the investment of its nearest competitor, establishing a clear competitive moat.
- **Market Valuation**: Currently, Suzano trades at a discount compared to its peers, not reflective of its strong position.

## Supply and Demand Model
- **Projected Dynamics**: The market is skeptical about the pulp demand's ability to absorb new capacity. However, analyses indicate that no significant new capacity will be feasible post-Cerrado development, strengthening integrated players like Suzano, particularly in tissue consumption.

## Cerrado Expansion Project
- **Efficiency Gains**: The Cerrado project is expected to produce more than 20% capacity increase, along with significant efficiency improvements, such as a reduced distance from forest to mill.
- **Financial Stability**: Even with lower price scenarios, the Cerrado expansion yields a projected **19% free cash flow margin**, highlighting sound investment.

## ESG Commitments
- **Sustainability Ratings**: Suzano excels in environmental governance but faces challenges in ESG ratings from agencies like MSCI, which may not reflect its efforts accurately.
- **Cost of Capital**: An analysis indicates that Suzano's focus on sustainable practices can lead to a **reduction in the cost of debt**, translating to an approximate **R$6 billion** benefit.

## Financial Projections
- **Revenue and Margins**: Expectations of a modest **3% revenue CAGR** from 2022 to 2033, mainly due to sufficient product rollouts and normalization of pulp prices. 
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks include lower pulp prices, but management's track record mitigates these concerns.

## Conclusion
Suzano stands out due to its unmatched cost position, overlooked positive catalysts, an upcoming mill project that enhances cash generation, and an under-recognized ESG profile. A blended valuation approach supports the **R$67 target price**, turning Suzano into an attractive investment opportunity for future growth amid anticipated industry changes.
